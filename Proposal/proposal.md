# Project Title
Color it Back!

# Background and Overview
This game was inspired by nongrams. Nonograms are picture logic puzzles in which 
cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side 
of the grid and once completed, the grid reveals a hidden picture. I wanted to 
make this game because I enjoy playing these types of games.
